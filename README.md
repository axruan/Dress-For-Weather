# Dress to Weather

This app uses weather and location APIs from AccuWeather that provides forecast information for a specific location, then recommends an outfit based on the temperature and conditions. Currently, it can only get information from the United States. If no location is found within U.S., an alert window pops up to notify users. 

Upon entering the app, a map and search bar are displayed. You can either manually naviagte around the map, or enter a specific location. On the map, you can drag and zoom (shift + option + touchpad on the simulator) to find a location. Then, press the blue plus button in the center to set a pin. The blue button is always present and in the center, and pins can only be made by pressing on it. 

You can create as many pins as you want. Click the pin to display a pop-up, in which you can either delete the pin or check further details. If you click "check weather", a tab view will appear, one with forecast information only, and the other with some forecast information and a recommended outfit. Five days will be shown, including the current day. On the outfit view, you can also switch between sexes; male or female outfits will be shown accordingly.

Since AccuWeather free account allows max of 50 API calls a day, when the limit is reached, a popup alert window is shown to notify users and placeholder images are displayed.
